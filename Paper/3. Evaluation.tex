\section{Future Changes}
An obvious future change is the expansion of the languages with all sorts of commands. Commands that just interact with the character are rather simple, as it is passed in to the function. Interaction
with objects outside of the avatar have not been written, and therefore there's no way to interact with things outside the character. 

As the language grows, there could be a need for more speed, and some form of compilation. Due to the very AST-like way of storing a "compiled" program, it shouldn't be hard to convert it into machine
code, especially with compiler backends like llvm.

One language feature missing is conditionals: the humble if-statement. This would be really easy to implement as a Command.
