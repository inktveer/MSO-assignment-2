\section{Clarifications}
Door Quill\\ 

For the purpose of this assignment, after the clarifications, which are directed at the stakeholders of LearningApp, the assumptions that we made are discussed, as an answer to the clarifications themselves. The absence of actual stakeholders is an inhibiting factor to the further writing of this report. As such, the assumptive answer to the problem is proposed in a section directly below it. \\

\paragraph{Grid size}
The size of the grid is unclear. The demo picture showing the trace of the individual moving is 3x3, but an infinite grid size is implied. Should LearningApp have support for variable grid sizes, only for 3x3, only for infinite ones, or for all of those?\\~\\
-> clarification

\paragraph{Hard Coded Examples}
The hard coded examples are small programs that move the character in pre-programmed ways. Should these be able to call each other, or will these be units on their own?\\
-> clarification

\paragraph{Effects of execution}
There is an emphasis placed on the execution needing to only have a console output as effect. However, the wording implies that more effects will be added in the future. Does LearningApp need to have an API to interact with this, or will this be dealt with once that times comes?\\
-> clarafication

\paragraph{Command line input}
It is unclear whether the program should allow for command line based execution of programs, where the user types in the program inline, or whether this is not an option and a text file is the only option. \\
-> clarification

\paragraph{Optimization}
It could happen that the file detects a program that contains a redundancy. For instance, the pawn walks back and forth over the same path, thereby not changing the touched squares nor the end position of the pawn. Should these be optimized out, or is this behaviour out of scope for the project? And if they should be optimized, does the travelled path matter, or is the only important thing the end position, in which case more optimization could be performed?\\~\\
Note that optimization is incompatible with inline command line input. That means that the optimization would be disabled during inline compiling. If consistent behaviour is of essence, it would also be an option to choose either but not both at the same time. This would lead to changing behaviour of the metrics interface. 

\paragraph{Program levels}
Program levels are mentioned briefly, but nothing is specified about what those are or how they work. Could this be clarified?

\paragraph{Maximum nesting level}
It is required to include a way to get the maximum nesting level of a trace of a program, but it is not clarified how this is calculated. If there are no repeat commands that are called, is the nesting level 0 or 1? Furthermore, if a repeat command is called without it having any children commands, will this be considered to be an additional level of nesting or not?

        hello there! This is a cell that will be filled or something idk\\ Another test? Maybe? and not the Haskell type maybe just a test maybe
