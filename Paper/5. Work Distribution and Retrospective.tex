\chapter{Work Distribution}
It was noticeable that the distribution of work was different this time compared to last time. We designed the domain model together, while Aurora made the formal, worked out version. Quill started on the UML diagram using this outline. We discussed the structure of it together, while Quill workout out the formal version, including the contents and the relations between the classes, using Draw.io. The clarifications were written by Quill as well, as he focussed on that for the previous assignment too, which scored a high grade. The contents of the clarifications were implemented into the UML diagram together. Quill wrote the general code structure in C\# and filled about half of it with actual contents. Aurora made the \ffcode{Importer} and related classes and the unit tests, which we then integrated into the document. Furthermore, she analysed and evaluated the class structure in the Evaluation section.
