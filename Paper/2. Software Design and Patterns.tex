For now, the categorisation of sequences into basic, medium and advanced are only arbitrary categories without any difference between them, except the length of the list of commands it holds. The most logical way to implement this would be to have an enum with these categories as a public field within the sequence objects. However, this would not suffice if differentiating code would be added to these different categories. As this is suspected to happen, the categories are implemented as a class hierarchy. 

\section{Design Patterns}
The main pattern that is applied, is the \textit{Command}. The \ffcode{Command} abstract class holds the main execute method that can be called on all the sub-commands. This smooths out the process of executing the commands within the data structure they are held in. \\~\\

For the \ffcode{Command} abstract class and the \ffcode{Repeat} subclass, the \textit{Composite} design pattern is very suitable, because it allows us to treat a piece of program to be treated the same as a single command, making the system very flexible. Furthermore, it allows the tree-like structure of the input to be modelled as a data structure. \\~\\

Within the structure of the sequences and the commands, an \textit{Factory Method} pattern is used to more easily produce large numbers of them. This minimises the amount of code duplication in the \ffcode{Init} class, where the hard coded programs are written out.\\~\\

Finally, a \textit{Strategy} is used for the structure of the sequences itself. Instead of calling on the specific subclass, the \ffcode{Trace()} method of the superclass is called. This spares the necessity for lots of useless iteration and clunky code. \\~\\

The \textit{Iterator} design pattern was applied to It smooths the process of iterating through all the commands, and enables a very elegant implementation of the \ffcode{Load()} method in the \ffcode{Sequence} class. \ffcode{Trace} returns a concrete iterator called \ffcode{TraceEnumerator}, which defines the behaviour for the iteration.
